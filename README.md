# OpenCV Projects
Playing around with some of the basic OpenCV functionality using input from both video files and streaming video from a webcam.

## simple object tracking
Tracking objects manually tagged with a bounding box.

## object detection
Use imported neural network classifier to identify and track objects (people, faces, hand landmarks)


So far I am only working in Python, but I may work on a C++ implementation in the future to see if there are any changes to the framerate.
